# LosPets ![alt text](https://s3.amazonaws.com/lospets-files/img/lospets_logo.png)

This project was born by an idea for my final project at Faculdade Senac RS de Porto Alegre.
The application has the objective to help people who lost their pets or people who rescued some pet from the streets to simple share the information and using geolocation to help them filter the data, helping the pet to return home.

I don't have any profit goals, the only costs are for system maintenance.
All the information saved in the application won't be shared with third party or other means beside the system functionalities.

If you want to collaborate you're more than welcome!
